#summary The logging framework
#labels Phase-Implementation

= Introduction =

The logging framework of the application is based on Java's {{{java.util.logging}}}. It contains two main classes: {{{Logger}}} & {{{Location}}}.


= Details =

== {{{Logger}}} ==

The {{{Logger}}} class is used mainly in order to get the location for the current class. The other single purpose of this class is to initialize the log files rotation mechanism.

== {{{Location}}} ==

This is the class which is being used for tracing the activity. It contains generic methods for logging ({{{log}}}, {{{logp}}}) and specific methods for tracing the path, debug messages & exception messages ({{{entering}}}, {{{exiting}}}, {{{debug}}}, {{{throwing}}}). It is highly recommended to use the specific methods, not the generic ones.

*An example for how to use the logging:*

{{{
Location location = Logger.getLocation(this.getClass());
location.entering("startServer(CommandArguments)", cmdArgs);
}}}
